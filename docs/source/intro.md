The Small Bodies dictionary contains classes and attributes 
specific to the techniques and processes of small bodies
research. In some cases the metadata provided in the SB dictionary
is specifically identified as supplemental to metadata contained 
in other namespaces - metadata that should also be present in the 
product label.
